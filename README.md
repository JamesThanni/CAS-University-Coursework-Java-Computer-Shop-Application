# Computer Accessories Shop

Welcome to the Computer Accessories Shop program developed in Java using object oriented programming methods. The task of this project was to develop a system in Java for a Computer Accessories Shop (CAS) to help an example business  handle many of the shopâ€™s activities in an easy and practical manner.

This is my first ever Object Oriented Programming Project and I look forward to learning more about OOP and producing more efficient software! :)

To run the project, run "java -jar cas.jar" in the directory.
