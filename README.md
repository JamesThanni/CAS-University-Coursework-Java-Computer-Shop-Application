# Computer Accessories Shop

Welcome to the Computer Accessories Shop app developed in Java using object oriented programming methods. The task of this project was to develop a system in Java for a Computer Accessories Shop (CAS) to help an example business handle many activities in an easy and practical manner. This is my first ever Object Oriented Programming Project and I look forward to learning more about OOP and producing more efficient software! :)

## Instructions
To run the project, run "java -jar cas.jar" in the directory. All source code and java files are located in the "cas-cwk" folder. To operate the program, search for items with the search button, select them by clicking on the table row and once added to basket, you may test the available functionalities.


## FAQ
- Items list in blank initially: Clear the search input textbox and press search.
